Ground rules:

- self-contained module
  -everything to do w/my module is in my module
  -no global vars
  -if a module manages more than one thing, it should be split up

-seperation of concerns

-DRY code: Don't Repeat Yourself

-efficient DOM usage
  -very few $(selections)

-no mem leaks
  -all events can be unbound
